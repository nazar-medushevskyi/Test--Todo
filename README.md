Todoist is the world's number one to-do list and task manager. It will help you achieve focus, organization, and tranquility.

This application utilizes technologies such as React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Context, and much more.

- When the form is submitted, the page does not refresh, but the item is still added to the list

- When an item is created, it is saved in the page's localStorage

- Each item in the list has the option to be deleted and the option to "check" the task

- All checked tasks will be moved to the bottom list

- You can uncheck a task to return it to the main list

- You can refresh the page and see the same tasks you created
